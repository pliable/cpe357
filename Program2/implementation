Basic idea:

use hash table for words.

words are structs which contain the following data:
   char *word; //the actual word
   int occurrences; //number of occurences of this word
   int isActive; //don't think is needed, but is used to tell if it's present or not in the hash table

to resolve collision issue, open addressing with quadratic probing can be used. however, an iterator would need
   to be implemented. which might suck.
