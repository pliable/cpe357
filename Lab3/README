I *believe* this program produces valid Huffman codes. I am able to 
produce a tree, and iterate through the entire tree, printing the
contents whether it's a leaf or an inner node just fine, and in
comparing those results to hand worked out huffman encodings, they
matched.

However, I did not
manage to implement a secondary sort on the linked list, therefore,
results will be different from your implementation, thus failing most
tests that compare with your version of htable. I figured this out
by realizing that characters with the same count get inserted into
the linked list correctly, however, when the huffman algorithm
is run through, because characters with the same count are in different
order (by their char), they will be combined with different counts.
