Run "make" or "make parseline" to compile

If this finds an error while parsing, it will print the entire command
line instead of just the command. For example:

% parseline
line: ls < a < b | more
ls: bad input redirection

This is how your program prints it out, while mine prints it out like
so:

% parseline
line: ls < a < b | more
ls < a < b : bad input redirection

This is due to my logic being redonkulously insane.

Also, I apologize for not splitting this into multiple source files. I
have a terrible habit of not doing that :(

Please go easy on me oh god oh god
