run make to compile

I didn't get to implement proper signal handling, but I believe I handled
signals for child processes.

It's also very hacky, and one huge source file, and I think I already
explained I've been very anxious about this assignment, so in starting
it so late, it's...very hacky.

But it actually works to an extent, and in playing around with it,
it's very cool :)
